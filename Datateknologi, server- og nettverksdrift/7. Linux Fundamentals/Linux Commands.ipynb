    "**CHMOD command**\n",
    "* **Purpose**: **chmod** is a command in Unix-like operating systems that is used to change the permissions of a file or directory. \n",
    "\n",
    "**File mode bits**\n",
    "* In unix-like operating systems, each file and directory has associated permissions, represented by file mode bits. These permissions defined who can read, write or execute the file, and are usually represented by a three-digit octal number. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Usage**\n",
    "* **Syntax**: ```chmod [options] mode file```\n",
    "    * mode: specifies the new permissions to be set. It is represented in octal format or symbolic notation. \n",
    "    * file: specifies the file or directory whose permissions are to be changed. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Options**:\n",
    "* **755**: This is an example of octal notion. Each digit in the octal number represents permissions for different user categories: \n",
    "    * The first digit (*7*) represents permissions for the file owner. \n",
    "    * The second and the third digits (**5** and **5**) represent permissions for the group owner and others respectively. \n",
    "    * In octal notion, the digits correspond to the sum of the permissions:\n",
    "        * **4** stands for read (*r*)\n",
    "        * **2** stands for write (*w*)\n",
    "        * **1** stands for execute (*x*)\n",
    "\n",
    "    * so **755** means:\n",
    "        * The file owner has read (4), write (2) and execute (1) permissions (4 + 2 + 1 = 7)\n",
    "        * The group owner and others have read (4) and execute (1) permissions (4 + 1 = 5)  \n",
    "\n",

    "    - **Explanation:** Changes the file mode bits of a file or directory.\n",
    "    - **When to use:** To set or modify file or directory permissions.\n",
    "    - **Example:** `chmod 755 filename` (sets read, write, and execute permissions for owner, and read and execute permissions for others)\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Symbolic notation**\n",
    "* Instead of using octal notation, you can also use symbolic notation to represent permissions:\n",
    "    * **u** represents the file owner.\n",
    "    * **g** represents the group owner. \n",
    "    * **o** represents others. \n",
    "    * **+** adds permissions\n",
    "    * **-** remove permissions \n",
    "    * **r** stands for read \n",
    "    * **w** stands for write \n",
    "    * **x** stands for execute\n",
    "* **For example**:\n",
    "    * **chmod u+rwx, g+rx, o+rx filename**: Gives read, write and execute permissions to the file owner, and read and execute permissions to the group owner and others. \n",

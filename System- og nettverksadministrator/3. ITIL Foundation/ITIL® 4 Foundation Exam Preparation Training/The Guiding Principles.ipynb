    "Reusing existing resources whenever possible instead of reinventing the wheel over and over again. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Progres iteratively with feedback** <br>\n",
    "Do not do everything at once, take baby-steps instead. Learning by doing with lots of feedback. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Collaborate and promote visibility** <br>\n",
    "Involve the right people at the right time and gather factual data to make the right decisions. \n",

    "5. **Think and work hollistically** <br>\n",
    "Nothing is ever alone, think about the effect of your initiative or work on other components.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Keep it simple and practical** <br>\n",
